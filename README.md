## TriTracker Description

TriTracker is a triathlon workout tracking application. For whose who may not know, a triathlon is a sport that encompasses 3 different disciplines (Swim, Bike, and Run). For those training for their next race or just working out for health and fun TriTracker is a great tool.

Using TriTracker is very quick and easy. When you are signed in you will see your workouts page. Each workout will be categorized according to their discipline and put into chronological order by date.

Whenever you have finished a wokout you can simply add a new workout, by clicking the "Add Workout" button and filling out the form. You will be required to fill in the date, discipline, and workout type and you can also add in additional information on time, distance, and any notes you may have.

TriTracker has complete CRUD capabilities as you can create, read, update, and delete any of your workouts.

TriTracker also has a community page that lets you see other members and their workouts! "Because We Are Stronger Together!"
